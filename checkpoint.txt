1. Version control is important for maintaining a working copy of a file or project, while keeping previous iterations of that project, with each iteration containing varying changes and edits made. It would be important to use version control for our projects as we may create a working version, but decide we want to update a subsection or modify some component of it - we will then have a newer version containing those updated components. If we determine that our newer, updated version is unsatisfactory and that we instead prefer the first version, we can always easily revert back to that first version because we have separated our work chronologically.

2. Using the git book and documentation provided through [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) has proven to be a great resource. [Codeacademy](https://www.codeacademy.com/) also has a section on how to use basic git commands that was helpful.

3. Branches are useful because it allows us to have a working copy/*clone* of the current project, where we can make edits and changes consistent with that branches theme (ex: only changing a specific function or related service in that branch), then go through a process of reviewing the work done in the branch (via a *pull request*), before finally *merging* the altered work on the branch with the *master* project. The branch can be saved or later deleted, but is useful to have in case we want to travel back to work done on that branch and view the worklog.

4. The purpose of a remote is to allow collaboration or updated work to be accessed easily through a network connection. If I wanted to work on a project while traveling, I could clone a copy of the remote repository and now have a local repository that I can edit. Then, once I'm satisfied with my work, I can push the work/commits made on the local repository to the remote repository. This allows for synchronous collaboration and for multiple persons to be working on a project simultaneously while being confident they are working on the most up-to-date version of the project.

5. It's important to track upstream changes after creating the initial fork because we want to make sure we are working on the most up-to-date version - other persons may have contributed work to the remote repository, and we want to have the work reflected in our local repository. Thus we would use ```git pull``` or ```git fetch``` to retrieve that work and ensure our local repository is up to date.
