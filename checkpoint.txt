1. Version control is important for maintaining a working copy of a file or project, while keeping previous iterations of that project, with each iteration containing varying changes and edits made. It would be important to use version control for our projects as we may create a working version, but decide we want to update a subsection or modify some component of it - we will then have a newer version containing those updated components. If we determine that our newer, updated version is unsatisfactory and that we instead prefer the first version, we can always easily revert back to that first version because we have separated our work chronologically.

2. Using the git book and documentation provided through [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) has proven to be a great resource. [Codeacademy](https://www.codeacademy.com/) also has a section on how to use basic git commands that was helpful.

3. Branches are useful because it allows us to have a working copy/*clone* of the current project, where we can make edits and changes consistent with that branches theme (ex: only changing a specific function or related service in that branch), then go through a process of reviewing the work done in the branch (via a *pull request*), before finally *merging* the altered work on the branch with the *master* project. The branch can be saved or later deleted, but is useful to have in case we want to travel
